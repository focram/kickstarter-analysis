# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- This projects purpose was to help a hypothetical client acquire information about a planned kickstarter campaign. 
- Through the sorting of datasets and datapoints we are able to analyze recurring trends in kickstarter campaigns. 
- Such a process will allow for the highest rate of success in launching the campaign. 
## Analysis and Challenges
While the instructions were clear, certain challenges did arise. I was not obtaining the correct outcome numbers within the pivot table & charts.
Later realized this was due to me filtering out certain results. I was also being presented with a *blank* option which made my table very unappealing.
I filtered out and removed the blank option. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Judging by the data, it becomes clear that the best time of year to launch a campaign, including theater campaigns, is preferably May or even June. 
While other months tend to have comparable success, May sees a higher percentage of successful campaigns compared to other months. 
One should attempt to avoid launching a campaign of any type in the winter months, especially December which has an abyssmal success rate of under 50 percent. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Outcomes based on goal can show us where most of the money lies. Smaller budget and easier to fund campaigns seem to reach their goal more often. Sub 5000 dollar goals
seem to have the highest success rate at around 74.5%. 
Anything after this up until around 25,000$ floats around a 50% success rate and then dips into a low 23% success rate.
Only 13% of campaigns over $50,000 have ever been successfully funded.

#### Limitations of This Dataset
- The dataset seems to be limited in it's ability to explain certain trends. It does build a good base to work upon but more information is needed in order to draw
conclusions as to ***WHY*** certain trends occurr.

- We can also see the relation between spotlighted kickstarters alongside their success rate. Aditionally, we can gather information as to why May seems to be so 
popular among successful kickstarters? Is December a bad month due to holiday spending? Why does donating on kickstarter decrease during holiday months?
